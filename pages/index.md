# George Danforth
I am a software engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently employed at Databricks, where I work on database-related things. I have previously worked at various other technology startups, doing everything from frontend web development, to cloud infrastructure, data platforms, and more. My areas of interest include systems programming, databases, distributed systems, networking, and graphics programming.

Outside of software development, I enjoy listening to and creating music, reading (fiction and philosophy primarily), rock climbing, and working on various unfinished extracurricular programming projects.
